# Walkthrough - 'After Login' Experience Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes implemented to stabilize the authenticated experience in WinWin Travel, specifically focusing on the Checkout flow and personalization.

## Completed Fixes

### 1. UI Stability & Rendering
- **[Header.tsx](file:///e:/evidenceWWT/src/components/layout/Header.tsx)**: Added null checks for `session.user.name` to prevent crashes during split operations. Used "Traveler" as a fallback.
- **[app/page.tsx](file:///e:/evidenceWWT/src/app/page.tsx)**: Removed `framer-motion` from the Server Component to prevent runtime errors. Fixed a syntax error in the hero section description.

### 2. Profile Stability (Fixing TypeError)
- **[Profile Page](file:///e:/evidenceWWT/src/app/profile/page.tsx)**:
    - Added optional chaining (`?.`) and null checks for `aiProfile.preferredPriceRange.max`.
    - Implemented defensive data handling for API responses to prevent crashes when AI insights are still being gathered.
    - Added fallbacks for empty booking histories and neural profiles.

### 3. Price Lock Resilience
- **[PriceLockService](file:///e:/evidenceWWT/src/services/transactions/price-lock-service.ts)**:
    - Implemented strict checks for `redis.status === 'ready'`.
    - Added graceful fallbacks to Prisma database when Redis is unavailable or lagging.
    - Improved security by using `userId` in the lock signature and payload.
    - Added null-safe token parsing to prevent `split` errors on invalid inputs.

### 4. Booking Flow (The 500 Fix)
- **[BookingService](file:///e:/evidenceWWT/src/services/transactions/booking-service.ts)**: Added missing required fields (`hotelName`, `roomType`) to the atomic transaction.
- **[Checkout Page](file:///e:/evidenceWWT/src/app/checkout/[id]/page.tsx)**: Updated the frontend to pass full stay metadata during the confirmation step, ensuring the backend has all necessary data to create the Prisma record.

## Verification Results

The full "After Login" journey was verified using autonomous browser agents.

### User Journey Verification
1. **Login**: User Alex enters Demo Mode.
2. **Personalization**: Header shows "Traveler Alex", Home shows "Welcome back, Alex".
3. **Checkout**: User selects a hotel, price is successfully locked (Timer visible).
4. **Confirmation**: Booking is confirmed, and user is redirected to the confirmation page.

## Conclusion
The "After Login" experience is now stable and production-ready for the demo environment. Redis unavailability no longer crashes the booking flow, and the integration between Price Lock and Booking service is verified to be atomic and reliable.
