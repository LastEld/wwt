# Prompt 9: Frontend - Details & Optimistic Interactions

---

## [MESSAGE 1: IGNITION]

### Task
Implement the deep hotel view and optimistic UI logic for reactions.

### Requirements
- **Detail Page**: Implement the tabbed hotel view (Room, Lodge, Location, Reviews) in `src/app/hotel/[id]/page.tsx`.
- **Optimization**: Use React Server Components (RSC) for static meta-data and Client Components for interaction.
- **Optimistic UI**: Implement TanStack Query mutations for Like/Dislike that update the UI instantly (before server confirmation).
- **Maps**: Integrate an interactive map (e.g., Mapbox or Google Maps) showing the hotel and nearby attractions.

### Output
A deep, interactive hotel view that feels "instant" when liking or switching tabs.
