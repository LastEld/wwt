## The Genesis Prompt (Message 1 of the Cycle)

"Hello. I am building the **WinWin Travel Platform**, a high-performance, AI-personalized hotel search and booking engine. 

I have a complete architectural specification ready. Your task is to act as the **Lead Engineer** and build this platform sequentially in **2-Message Cycles** for each of the 12 prescribed steps.

### Our Iterative Process:
For each build step (e.g., Step 1: Foundation):
1.  **Message 1 (Ignition)**: I will provide the build requirements. You will implement the core code.
2.  **Message 2 (Healing)**: I will ask you to audit and refine your work. You will then provide the final, non-mock, 100% complete logic.

### Initial Instructions:
1.  **Read and understand the Project Atlas**: Begin by reading the root **[README.md](file:///e:/evidenceWWT/README.md)**.
2.  **Initialize Context**: Read the **[AI Documentation Navigator](file:///e:/evidenceWWT/docs/ai_docs_navigator.md)** and the **[Coding Rules Skill](file:///e:/evidenceWWT/skills/coding_rules.md)**. These rules are mandatory for all code you generate.
3.  **Start Build Step 1**: Once you have processed the documentation landscape, open **[01_foundation.md](file:///e:/evidenceWWT/prompts/builder/01_foundation.md)** and implement the `[MESSAGE 1: IGNITION]` requirements.

Are you ready to begin with Step 1: Project Foundation?"
