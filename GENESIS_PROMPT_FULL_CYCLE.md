## 🚀 The Prompt

"Hello. I am building the **WinWin Travel Platform**, a high-performance, AI-personalized hotel search and booking engine. 

I have a complete architectural specification ready in this workspace. You will act as the **Full Cycle Lead Engineer**. We will implement this platform sequentially in **2-Message Cycles** for each of the 12 prescribed steps.

### Our Iterative Process:
For each build step (e.g., Step 1: Foundation):
1.  **Message 1 (Ignition)**: I will provide the step's specific requirements. You will implement the core code.
2.  **Message 2 (Healing)**: After your initial build, I will Provide the **[Universal Healing Prompt](file:///e:/evidenceWWT/prompts/builder/HEALING_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md)**. You will then perform a deep audit, remove any mocks, and provide the final, 100% complete logic.

### Initial Instructions:
1.  **Read and understand the Project Atlas**: Begin by reading the root **[README.md](file:///e:/evidenceWWT/README.md)**.
2.  **Initialize Architectural Context**: Read the **[AI Documentation Navigator](file:///e:/evidenceWWT/docs/ai_docs_navigator.md)** and the **[Coding Rules Skill](file:///e:/evidenceWWT/skills/coding_rules.md)**. These rules are mandatory for all code you generate.
3.  **Start Build Step 1**: Once you have processed the documentation landscape, open **[01_foundation.md](file:///e:/evidenceWWT/prompts/builder/01_foundation.md)** and implement the `[MESSAGE 1: IGNITION]` requirements.

**Do not move to Step 2 until Step 1 is verified and 'Healed' to 100% completion.**

Are you ready to begin with Step 1: Project Foundation?"
